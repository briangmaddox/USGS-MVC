   Version 1.0

      Initial cvs import.

   Version 1.1  March 1 1995

      Added ChangeLog (this file).

      Improved expose event handling in View2D and DisplayDevice classes.

      Added layer and selection control to Component2D classes.

   Version 1.2  March 3 1995

      Modified Model2D to use a sorted linked list to manage the 
      Component2D database.

      Added the LinkedList and ListElement classes.

      Moved experimental expose and resize methods from ZoomController
      up to Controller. These new methods restore from a graphics
      buffer (if one is available) in response to expose events.

   Version 1.3  April 21 1995

      Added SelectController class. Provides a simple interface for 
      selecting and moving (moveTo) a component.

      Added XOR drawing capability.

      Changed the way Cursors are set and queried.

      Added install() and uninstall() methods to Controller class. Currently
      used to change cursor when installing new Controller.

      Added setLineWidth() method to DisplayDevice and Component2D classes.

      Added reset() method to Controller class. 

      Added select() method to Controller class. This allows the user of the
      class to directly set which component is currently selected.

   Version 1.4 (not tagged yet)

      Added XTrueColorDisplayDevice and XPsuedoColorDisplayDevice classes.
      XView2D now creates the appropriate class for the given visual.

      Added a "drag-zoom" option to ZoomController. Dragging with first
      mouse button opens a box indicating area to zoom to.

      Added XMultiView2D class. View that manages multiple viewports centered
      on points in a list.

      Added setViewport to DisplayDevice and XDisplayDevice classes.

      Added MVC.h and MVC.cc which defines a global instance of ColorManager
      and Model2D. This simplifies certain method calls if the user of the
      library chooses to use the global version instead of their own.

      MVC can now be set up using the 'configure' script generated by 
      autoconf. autoconf requires configure.in, makefile.in and the files
      in the config directory.

      Model2D.addView and Model2D.deleteView now work.

      Added methods setEveryWorldSpaceWin, setEveryFullView and 
      zoomEveryFullView to Model2D.
      
      XMultiView2D finally works. 

      Added PolyLineComponent2D class.

      Added computeBoundingBox() methods to LineComponent2D and 
      PolyLineComponent2D.

      Added getModelBoundingBox() method to Model2D.
